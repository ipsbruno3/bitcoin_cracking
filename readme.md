# üöÄ Bitcoin Seed Recovery with OpenCL  

This project demonstrates the optimization of OpenCL kernels to recover Bitcoin **BIP-39 mnemonics** when only **7 out of 12 words** are known. The challenge required exploring a search space of **2.25 quadrillion combinations** with maximum GPU efficiency.  

---

## üéØ Problem  

Reconstructing the missing 5 words of a BIP-39 mnemonic (including checksum validation) involves:  

- **Search space**: 2.25 √ó 10^15 possibilities  
- **Target**: Efficient validation of candidate seeds at scale  

Through aggressive kernel optimization (memory efficiency, loop unrolling, reduced overhead), a **RTX 4090 Ti** achieved over **2 million seed validations per second**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Optimizations  

1. **Multi-Address Hash Check**  
   Hash maps enable constant-time (`O(1)`) checks against multiple candidate addresses.  

2. **Bit-Masked Mnemonic Representation**  
   Mnemonics are stored as `ulong` bitmasks instead of strings, drastically reducing overhead.  

3. **Loop Unrolling**  
   SHA-256 inner loops are unrolled with conditional checks removed, reducing per-iteration cost.  

4. **Optimized SHA-512 Buffers**  
   Reduced loop iterations from 128 ‚Üí 16 per block using compact `ulong` arrays.  

5. **Vectorized Operations**  
   Leveraging 8‚Äì16 byte vector copies for faster memory transfers.  

6. **Precomputation of Fixed Words (To-Do)**  
   Cache SHA-512/SHA-256 of the 7 known words to avoid redundant work.  

7. **Python Multi-threading for Resource Control**  
   Python orchestrates memory management and database handling across GPUs.

## üöÄ Results  

- **Throughput**: Up to **12B SHA-256 ops/sec** and **3B SHA-512 ops/sec** with tuned kernels.  
- **Memory Efficiency**: Compact data structures and reduced buffer sizes.  
- **Scalability**: Kernels scale linearly across multiple GPUs.

## üîÆ Next Steps  

1. **Multi-GPU Support** ‚Äì enable distributed workloads across GPUs for linear scaling.  
2. **Address Derivation & Comparison** ‚Äì implement BIP-32/BIP-44 derivation to generate addresses and match against user-provided or blockchain data.
